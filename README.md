## Phase 1

In this phase, the aim is to remove noise from an audio file and denoise the signals. The phase1smaple.wav file in the project folder is provided for this use.

### Steps


1. Open the python file (p1.py)
2. The audio signal has been visualized and plotted for analysis.
3. **Fourier Transform** has been performed on the input signal to analyze its frequency components.
4. Noise frequencies have been identified in the Fourier domain.
5. Noise has been filtered out while retaining the main signal frequencies.
6. The denoised signal has been compared with the original one.
7. The denoised time-domain signal has been obtained using inverse Fourier Transform and plotted.

## Phase 2

This phase involves the implementation of a simple equalizer process using predefined frequency bands

### Steps

1. 10 frequency bands within the human auditory range have been generated.
2. Each frequency band has been amplified according to the provided input values.
3. The equalizer has been integrated into the denoising process from Phase One.
